# Update Plugin Metadata

Repo-local workflow for keeping plugin metadata consistent across the Codex marketplace.

## Outcome

Update all metadata surfaces affected by the request while preserving this repo's schemas and
keeping plugin discovery, README summaries, skill UI metadata, and default prompts consistent.

Stop when the affected surfaces are aligned and validation has passed. If the requested metadata
change implies a plugin rename, schema change, or new skill body, update only the safe surfaces and
report the remaining work instead of guessing.

## Source Of Truth

- Follow `plugins/AGENTS.md` for manifest conventions and skill metadata placement.
- Plugin metadata lives in `plugins/<plugin-name>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Marketplace entries live in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
- Skill-level Codex UI metadata lives in
  `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml`.
- Plugin README files carry user-facing plugin summaries.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target plugin or plugins.
2. Read the plugin manifest and marketplace entry before editing.
3. Determine whether the request changes plugin name, version, description, author, repository,
   keywords, category, prompts, skill display names, skill descriptions, invocation policy, or
   README-visible summaries.
4. Update all affected metadata surfaces together.
5. Preserve schema-specific field names and shapes; do not normalize them into a different
   structure.
6. When evidence is missing, inspect the actual plugin directories and existing metadata before
   inventing names, summaries, prompts, or categories.
7. Run validation:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint:plugins
   pnpm format:check
   ```

8. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` when validation tooling changed.

## Consistency Rules

- Keep plugin `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `repository`, `keywords`, and `skills`
  aligned with the marketplace catalog and plugin directory.
- Use plugin-qualified Codex prompts such as `$plugin-name:skill-name`.
- Keep README skill lists aligned with actual `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/` directories.
- Do not add Codex-only policy keys to `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

## Boundaries

- Do not add a new skill body; use `add-skill`.
- Do not add a scaffold script or template unless the user explicitly asks for plugin creation
  automation.
- Do not commit changes unless the user asks.
