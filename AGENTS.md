# Project Overview

## Purpose

This project is a personal Codex plugin marketplace to provide a centralized place to capture my set
of personal skills.

## Tech Stack

- Typescript
- pnpm
- Oxfmt
- Oxlint
- Vitest

## Development Commands

- `pnpm check`: Run format, lint, typecheck, and plugin validation
- `pnpm format`: Use oxfmt to format all supported filetypes in the repo
- `pnpm format:check`: Use oxfmt to check all supported filetypes in the repo
- `pnpm lint`: Use Oxlint to lint TypeScript
- `pnpm lint:plugins`: Lint the Codex marketplace, plugin manifests, and skill metadata
- `pnpm lint:plugins:external`: Run plugin linting with opt-in network checks for external URLs and
  repositories
- `pnpm typecheck`: Use TypeScript to typecheck validation tooling
- `pnpm test`: Run the Vitest suite

## Project Conventions

- Commit messages must follow `conventional-commits:writing-conventional-commits`.
- Commitlint inherits 100-character limits for commit body and footer lines; wrap multi-line commit
  messages before running `git commit`.
- Keep `README.md` human-facing; put agent-operational guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep tests co-located in `src/`.
- Use `mise exec -- <command>` when reproducing local validation if the active shell runtime does
  not match `.node-version`.

## Glossary

Use this section for durable domain terms that should guide future work in this repository. Add or
update entries when a term becomes stable during planning, architecture review, or implementation.

When maintaining the glossary:

- Prefer the canonical term used by domain experts or project maintainers.
- Define what the term is in one tight sentence.
- List aliases to avoid when multiple words could refer to the same concept.
- Flag ambiguous words when the same word is used for different concepts.
- Include relationships between terms when they clarify ownership, lifecycle, or cardinality.
- Skip generic programming terms and incidental class, function, or module names unless they are
  part of the domain language.

| Term                    | Definition                                                                                                           | Aliases to Avoid          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Marketplace**         | The installable Codex plugin source published by this repository.                                                    | plugin repo, package      |
| **Marketplace catalog** | `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, the root list of plugins exposed by the marketplace.                             | manifest, registry        |
| **Plugin**              | A distributable bundle under `plugins/<plugin-name>/` with a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.                   | skill pack                |
| **Plugin manifest**     | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the plugin-level metadata consumed by Codex.                                            | marketplace entry         |
| **Marketplace entry**   | One plugin listing inside `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.                                                        | plugin manifest           |
| **Plugin skill**        | A shipped skill under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/`.                                                            | repo-local skill          |
| **Repo-local skill**    | A maintenance workflow under `.agents/skills/` used only while working in this checkout.                             | plugin skill              |
| **Skill body**          | `SKILL.md`, the runtime instructions and frontmatter for a skill.                                                    | metadata, prompt metadata |
| **Codex UI metadata**   | `agents/openai.yaml`, the skill-level display metadata and invocation policy for Codex.                              | skill frontmatter         |
| **Invocation policy**   | The `policy.allow_implicit_invocation` setting that decides whether Codex may load a skill automatically.            | trigger policy            |
| **Manual-only skill**   | A skill with `allow_implicit_invocation: false`; it should be invoked explicitly by the user.                        | disabled skill            |
| **Implicit invocation** | Codex automatically injecting a skill because the user prompt matches the skill description.                         | auto-trigger              |
| **Trigger fixture**     | A committed YAML file of positive and negative cases used to evaluate implicit invocation behavior.                  | skill test                |
| **Trigger eval**        | A development-only run that checks whether one skill invokes or skips for each trigger fixture case.                 | validation gate           |
| **Invocation signal**   | The observed evidence that Codex injected the target skill, currently stderr telemetry with `codex.skill.injected`.  | canary                    |
| **Eval artifact**       | Generated trigger-eval output under `.local/skill-evals/`, not committed project state.                              | fixture                   |
| **Plugin linter**       | The local validator behind `pnpm lint:plugins`, covering marketplace, manifest, skill, and metadata consistency.     | validator                 |
| **External validation** | Opt-in network or remote URL checks run separately from default local plugin linting.                                | normal linting            |
| **Brainstorm**          | A read-only exploration workflow that researches and compares solution directions before planning.                   | idea list                 |
| **Plan**                | A convergence workflow that turns a chosen direction into an implementation-ready plan.                              |                           |
| **Build**               | The implementation workflow that delivers working vertical slices with pragmatic validation while interfaces settle. | prototype                 |
| **TDD**                 | The implementation workflow that delivers behavior through red-green-refactor cycles.                                | testing phase             |
| **Diagnostic**          | A structured plugin-linter finding with a code, file, message, and pointer.                                          | error string              |
| **Validation context**  | The shared lint-run state passed through plugin-linter checks instead of module-level mutable globals.               | globals                   |
| **Metadata surface**    | Any file that exposes plugin or skill metadata and must stay aligned with adjacent surfaces.                         | docs                      |
| **Default prompt**      | A suggested prompt shown by Codex for invoking a plugin or skill.                                                    | description               |
| **Trigger contract**    | The `description` text that defines when a skill should be implicitly invoked.                                       | skill summary             |

Relationships:

- A **Marketplace** contains one **Marketplace catalog**.
- A **Marketplace catalog** contains one or more **Marketplace entries**.
- A **Marketplace entry** points to one **Plugin**.
- A **Plugin** owns one **Plugin manifest** and zero or more **Plugin skills**.
- A **Plugin skill** owns one **Skill body** and one **Codex UI metadata** file.
- **Brainstorm** can hand off a preferred direction to **Plan**; **Plan** can hand off an
  implementation-ready plan to **Build** or **TDD**.
- A **Trigger eval** runs **Trigger fixtures** against one implicitly invokable **Plugin skill**.
- **Eval artifacts** are generated under `.local/` and should not be committed.
- **Plugin linter** checks are local and deterministic by default; **External validation** is
  opt-in.
